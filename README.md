The contents of the repository are this way defined: 
- The usual `main.ipynb` file which is the main notebook. The visualization/front-end part of the homework was done directly there. Notice that in the main notebook points from backend (2.) and frontend (3.) were presented side by side. Therefore, the functionality is presented together with the visualization of its output.
- `func_modules` is the package containing the requested functionalities (i.e. the backend part of the homework).
- The `CommandLine.sh` file is the file containing the solution for the command line question.
- `partial_notebooks` is a folder which contains the notebooks which were used to build the main one.

This is the _nbviewer_ link to the main notebook:
